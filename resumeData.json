    "bio":"I'm a senior software engineer working for a Munich based company and volunteering as a team lead and trainer for programming courses at Female Tech Leaders organization. I enjoy fullstack web development and playing around with new and challenging technologies. One of my hobbies are hackathons and I have won 2 so far – Audi Challenge at FC Bayern HackDays 2018 and the Best Pitch Award at HackDays Rhein-Neckar 2019. In my free time I'm most probably to be seen on the handball court playing handball for FC Bayern or travelling with my backpack.",
